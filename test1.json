During this meeting we plan to hold an election for the next LBA president, who will serve for the coming year. Past presidents will be present to explain the importance of the position and to help facilitate the voting process. This year we have four members interested in running for this position; please note that their professional profiles are attached. Make sure to review these profiles prior to the meeting. There will be a question-and-answer session with this year's candidates before voting begins. \r\nWe are anticipating a large turnout at this year's election, and hope that you will be able to join us on this important day. If, for some reason, you are unable to attend, we ask that you send in your vote using the attached mail-in ballot. You can send the form to Local Businesses of Albany, 121 S. Main St., Albany, NY 12019. Please make sure that your ballot arrives by November 17.\r\nOur bylaws state that a majority of the LBA's members must vote in the upcoming election in order for us to officially inaugurate a new president.

Via Rail runs six trains per day from Montreal to Toronto, so you’ll be able to choose the best time for your trip. Your seat will be assigned in advance, and you will be able to work online on your way to Toronto since Wi-Fi Internet is available on board. Let me know which train you want to take, and I’ll reserve your seat.\r\n\r\nBy the way, is Mr. Collins still going with you to the conference in Toronto? I know you asked me to book a ticket for him, but yesterday I was told that he may have to stay here due to the upcoming board meeting. Let me know soon\r\n \r\nMay 18\r\nTrain Number:\t \r\n31\t \r\n33\t \r\n635\t \r\n35\t \r\n37\t \r\n39\r\n \r\nDepart: Montreal\r\nArrive: Toronto\t06:35\r\n08:36\t10:00\r\n11:57\t12:50\r\n14:57\t15:10\r\n17:16\t16:45\r\n18:40\t18:05\r\n21:00\r\nMay 22\r\nTrain Number:\t \r\n30\t \r\n32\t \r\n634\t \r\n32\t \r\n36\t \r\n38\r\nDepart: Toronto\r\nArrive: Montreal\t06:36\r\n08:32\t09:27\r\n11:19\t12:45\r\n14:50\t15:10\r\n17:07\t16:25\r\n18:17\t17:50\r\n19:49\r\n \r\n\r\n ***********\r\nPassage 2:\r\n\r\nFrom: Renata Biske <renatab@Ind.com>\r\nTo: Lisa Sampson <lisasam@Ind.com>\r\nDate: May 1, 17:38:24\r\nSubject: Re: Train schedule\r\n \r\nI was held up in a meeting until four today. Sorry for the late reply.\r\n\r\nThank you for the information. I need to arrive in Toronto by 6 p.m. on May 18 because I have an important meeting scheduled at 6:30 in downtown Toronto. On May 22, the conference ends at noon but I have lunch plans, so I want to take the 15:10 train. If I am back in Montreal by around five, I’ll be able to go to Mike’s retirement party at 7:30! It’s good because I really want to be there.\r\n\r\nOh, I checked with Mr. Collins. What you heard is true. He has to prepare a presentation for the board meeting, and also attend several meetings with board members. So you don’t have to worry about his tickets.\r\n\r\nI have one last favor. Could you please contact Stacie Wallace in Vancouver and find out where Kenji and Nora will be staying during the conference? I need to go over the presentation material with them before the conference and make last-minute changes if necessary, so I want to stay at the same hotel.\r\nThanks for all your hard work.",
